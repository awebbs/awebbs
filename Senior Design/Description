These .pptx files are the powerpoint slideshow that was used for each part of our senior design team. 



491 CPSC EOS Presentation Team 11 Powerpoint is a slideshow that my senior design team 
presented on where we were at with our Boeing application. We worked weekly with Boeing reps to 
design an application per their requirements. It goes over our tech stack and plans for moving forward.

CPSC 492L Team 11 Spring Mid Semester Powerpoint slideshow was a continuance of our progress 
from where the senior design team was during our Boeing applications.

The CPSC 492L Team 11 Final Presentation is a Powerpoint slideshow that sums up what we as a 
team accomplished for our last great task while being a student. This was such a great experience 
and we felt honored to share the work we accomplished with Boeing and our peers.
