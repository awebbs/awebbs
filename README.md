A repository made public to show programs and projects that have been completed or Iâ€™m currently working on. 
Note: This repo is unfinished and I have more projects/programs to add that have not been pushed.

* The Educational-App is a program I am building because I desire to become familiar with the Angular framework, designing front-end interfaces, and because education is extremly important. Eventually I would love to design an application for homeschooling children with disabilies. My daughter is autistic and I found as a parent that there are not many resources in the public school system to meet my daughter's needs. This application is in it's infancy, as I just started designing it. 

* The RomToInt-Leetcode class solution I created. My submission passed 3999 test cases, my runtime was 7 ms and the memory usage was 6 MB.

* The directory "my-site" is an Angular project I'm working on to get more familiar with that application.

* The CPSC 315 HW files, are PowerPoint Slideshows for the Business Intelligence Tech course I had taken at Gonzaga. They are to demonstrate my ability to use various business intell software, like Tableau and Power BI to analyze data and design sheets, dashboards, and stories.

* Stack.py is a program that demonstrates my ability to implement a stack data structure and my ability to code in Python.

* The LLJava directory is a program written in Java that shows my understanding of the Linked List data structure written in Java.

* The hw2-linked-list-big-five-awebbs directory is an assignment I completed while at Gonzaga to show that I was capable of finishing a .h file that was to implement a linked list data structure in the C++ language. One of the tasks was to create methods for the big five: constructor, assignment constructure, move constructor, assignment operator, move operator, and a destructor.

* insertionSort.h and quickSort.h are programs written in the C++ language that demonstrates my ability to design these two sorting algorithms using the vector data structure. The programs also keep track of the number of moves and compares for a big-o analysis.
